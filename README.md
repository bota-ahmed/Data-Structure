# Data Structures in C++

This repository contains C++ implementations of several fundamental data structures.

## Introduction

This project provides clear and concise implementations of common data structures in C++.  It's intended as a learning resource and a foundation for other projects. The implementations prioritize clarity and efficiency.

## Data Structures Implemented

*   **Linked Lists:**
    *   Singly Linked List (Ordered)
    *   Singly Linked List (Unordered)
*   **Stacks:**
    *   Stack (Array-Based) - `stackAB`
    *   Stack (Linked-List Based) - `stackLLB`
*   **Queues:**
    *   Queue (Array-Based) - `queueAB`
    *   Queue (Linked-List Based) - `queueLLB`
*   **Heaps:**
    *   (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
